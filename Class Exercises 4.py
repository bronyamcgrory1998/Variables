#Write a program that will ask the user for two numbers a then divide one by the other. The number of times one goes into another and the remainder should be displayed. For example, If 3 and 2 were entered: 3/2 = 1 remainder 1. The input and output should be user friendly.
#BUT improve the question program to show only the integer part of the answer

numberA= int(input("1st number"))
numberB= int(input("2nd number"))

answer= numberA//numberB
print (answer)
